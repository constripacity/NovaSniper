# NovaSniper Price Tracker

A minimal, ToS-friendly price tracking service for Amazon and eBay built with FastAPI. The app tracks products, checks prices on a schedule, and emails you when your target price is reached. It is designed to use official APIs and intentionally avoids any anti-bot circumvention.

## Features
- FastAPI backend with endpoints to create, list, and delete tracked products
- SQLite persistence with SQLAlchemy
- Background scheduler to refresh prices at a configurable interval
- Email notifications via SMTP when targets are met
- Clear placeholders for Amazon Product Advertising API and eBay API integrations

## Safety and compliance
- No CAPTCHA bypassing or anti-bot evasion
- No automated checkout or human-behavior simulation
- Built to use official APIs; placeholder logic should be replaced with compliant API calls

```

## Installation
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values (database path, scheduler interval, SMTP credentials, and API keys).

## Configuration
Key environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` – SQLite URL (default `sqlite:///./tracked_products.db`)
- `CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` – How often to run price checks
- `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `FROM_EMAIL` – SMTP settings for email alerts
- `AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY`, `AMAZON_SECRET_KEY`, `AMAZON_PARTNER_TAG` – Amazon Product Advertising API
- `EBAY_APP_ID` – eBay API application key

## Running the app
Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
FastAPI will create the SQLite tables on startup and initialize the scheduler to run every `CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS`.

## Beginner-friendly Quick Start (Windows, no Git)
1. **Install Python** from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check "Add Python to PATH" during setup.
2. **Download the project ZIP:**
   - Visit the repository page and click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**.
   - Extract the ZIP to a folder such as `C:\\NovaSniper`.
3. **Open Command Prompt in the project folder:**
   - In File Explorer, open the extracted folder.
   - Click the address bar, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
4. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
5. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. **Create your `.env` file:**
   - Copy `.env.example` (in the project root) to `.env`.
   - You can keep the default SQLite path; optionally add SMTP and API keys for full functionality.
7. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
8. **Open in your browser:**
   - Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

### Mac/Linux notes
- Use `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` to create/activate the virtual environment.
- The rest of the commands are the same (replace `python` with `python3` if needed).

## Web dashboard
- Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to open the NovaSniper dashboard.
- Add products via the form (platform, URL/ID, target price, currency, notify email).
- View existing tracked products in the table, delete entries, or trigger a manual "Check Now" refresh for a single item.
- The dashboard is a thin layer over the same JSON API, so `/docs` remains available for API exploration.

## API usage
### Add a product to tracking
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tracked-products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "amazon",
    "product_id": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000000",
    "target_price": 99.99,
    "currency": "USD",
    "notify_email": "you@example.com"
  }'
```

### List tracked products
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/tracked-products
```

### Remove a tracked product
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/tracked-products/1
```

## Scheduler
An APScheduler job runs every `CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS` seconds. For each tracked product it:
1. Fetches the current price using the platform-specific logic (placeholder now; replace with official API calls).
2. Updates the record with the latest price and timestamp.
3. Sends an email alert once when the current price is at or below the target.

## Extending price fetching
`app/services/price_fetcher.py` contains extraction helpers and a placeholder price generator. Replace `get_current_price` with calls to:
- **Amazon Product Advertising API** (SearchItems/GetItems)
- **eBay Browse or Finding APIs**
Make sure to follow platform Terms of Service and keep requests light.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended for personal price tracking. It uses (or should use) official APIs and avoids any techniques that bypass website protections or automate purchases.
